name=OpenRES: Open Riverine Ecosystem Synthesis
description=A QGIS plugin for automated extraction of hydrogeomorphic features to support functional process zone classification of river networks.
about=The core features of OpenRES enable the automated extraction of elevation, precipitation, geology, valley widths, slopes, and river sinuosity from raster and vector data for each user-defined river segment (typically 5–10 km) along a river network. These features can then, through unsupervised classification methods, be used to define Functional Process Zones - repeatable and discontinuous hydrogeomorphic patches formed by catchment-scale geomorphology and flow that are theorized to link stream ecology to hydrology and geomorphology along riverscapes.
