name=OpenRES: Open Riverine Ecosystem Synthesis
description=A QGIS plugin for automated extraction of hydrogeomorphic features to support functional process zone classification of river networks.
about=OpenRES is a QGIS plugin for river and floodplain scientists, geomorphologists, and environmental managers who need to rapidly quantify hydrogeomorphic characteristics along river networks. The core tools automate the extraction of elevation (ELE), precipitation (PRE), geology (GEO), valley width (VW), valley floor width (VFW), the ratio of valley width to valley floor width (RAT), valley side slopes (LVS, RVS, MVS), down-valley slope (DVS), river sinuosity (SIN), channel belt width (CBW), and channel belt sinuosity (LCS, RCS, CBS) for each user-defined river segment (typically 5–10 km). OpenRES also includes geomorphology utility tools to help users generate key input layers such as valley floor polygons and channel belts. The metrics obtained using OpenRES can be used individually for river science or combined through unsupervised classification to define Functional Process Zones — repeatable, discontinuous hydrogeomorphic patches that link stream ecology with hydrology and geomorphology across river corridors.
